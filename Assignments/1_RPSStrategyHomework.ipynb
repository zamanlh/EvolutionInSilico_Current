You can see this particularly well in the `__init__` function. The underscores means this is a private function that you can't call yourself, but is used internally. In this case, `init` is used when a new object of this type is created. \n",

    "We'll keep track of the set of moves an individual can play, here it is just `['R', 'P', 'S']` since we're limiting ourselves to the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. We'll also store the throws this individual has made (`self.my_history`), as well as the throws its competitor made in case we want to use those to pick the next throw in the future (`self.partner_history`). And finally, we'll also record the fitness of the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few helper functions here as well like `reset` which just clears out the organisms memory and fitness so we can start a new competition, and `reproduce` that returns a new instance of the strategy so we can easily population the world with winning strategies. \n",
